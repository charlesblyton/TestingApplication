To Compile and Run Assignment 1:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
**You will need to remove the Assignment1Test.java file from the /src folder in order for the program to compile correctly.**

Navigate to Ass1Program folder in the Bash Console:
**On my system I will enter**
	cd ~/OneDrive*/Semester1 2022/Further Programming/Ass1Program
**On your system the folder will be located somewhere else**

To compile all of the .java files in the folder, enter the command:
	javac ./src/*.java

While still in the Ass1Program folder, enter the command:
	java -cp ./src RunProgram

I could not work out how to do this, it is something like;

javac -cp junit-4.13.2.jar;. Assignment1Test.java
